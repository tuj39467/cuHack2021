This application was developed using Android Studio to keep the sports fans engaged during commercial breaks! A quiz will show up for each team with two buttons that will launch a separate activity for each respective option. These activites use a scrolling feature that allows the user to scroll through to answer each multiple choice question where they could eventually submit to see their score! They will see a Toast message appear to see your score with some feedback about where you stand with the rest of the audience!
